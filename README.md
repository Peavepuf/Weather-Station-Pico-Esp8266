# Arduino Sensor Data Transmission to Thingspeak via ESP8266

This repository contains two code snippets for Arduino and ESP8266. The codes demonstrate how to collect sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude) from sensors connected to an Arduino board, transmit this data via serial communication to an ESP8266, and then send it to the Thingspeak platform for storage and visualization.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- ESP8266 board supported by Arduino IDE
- DHT11 sensor library
- BMP180 sensor library
- ESP8266WiFi library
- Thonny IDE
- Raspberry Pico H

Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your sensor setup or additional requirements.
